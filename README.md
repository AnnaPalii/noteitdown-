## NOTEITDOWN Application

## Description

This application can be used to write, save, and delete notes. In this app we use an express backend and save and retrieve note data from a JSON file.

## User Story

AS A user, I want to be able to write and save notes

I WANT to be able to delete notes I've written before

SO THAT I can organize my thoughts and keep track of tasks I need to complete

## Business Context

For users that need to keep track of a lot of information, it's easy to forget or be unable to recall something important. Being able to take persistent notes allows users to have written information available when needed.

## Functionality 

* The following HTML routes are created:

  * GET `/notes` - Should return the `notes.html` file.

  * GET `*` - Should return the `index.html` file

* The application  has a `db.json` file on the backend that will be used to store and retrieve notes using the `fs` module.

* The following API routes are created:

  * GET `/api/notes` - reads the `db.json` file and return all saved notes as JSON.

  * POST `/api/notes` - receives a new note to save on the request body, add it to the `db.json` file, and then return the new note to the client.

  * DELETE `/api/notes/:id` - receives a query parameter containing the id of a note to delete. This means you'll need to find a way to give each note a unique `id` when it's saved. In order to delete a note, you'll need to read all notes from the `db.json` file, remove the note with the given `id` property, and then rewrite the notes to the `db.json` file.

## Acceptance Criteria
